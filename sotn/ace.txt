My notes for the ACE route

Make sure you're playing on a NEW file
Don't get 41 hearts: we don't want the neutron bomb
Make sure you finish with zero hearts though (Heart Refresh)

==Alucard Game==
Kill all of the wargs and only the wargs.
Do not kill the zombies.
Do not pick up any gold drops.
Heart drops are okay/good?

==Death Skip==
DO NOT SLASH TURKEY BLOCK
Right Hand: Equip Heart Refresh
Do death skip with the Heart Refresh
Right Hand: Equip Alucard Sword
Right Hand: Swap "Row 2 Right" with "Row 3 Left"
