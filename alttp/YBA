My findings on YBA

Overworld Transition + Red Potion = Glitched circular fade-in (no effects)
Overworld Transition + Green Potion = Blue Potion (no side effects)
Overworld Transition + Blue Potion = Fake Flute

Underworld Subtile: Same effects as overworld, but screws up the scrolling

Underworld Supertile + Red Potion = Glitched circular fade-in, broken scrolling
Underworld Supertile + Green Potion = Fake Flute
Underworld Supertile + Blue Potion = Glitched Textbox
